# Heart-disease-prediction-system

This project focuses on using machine learning to predict the risk of heart disease based on patient data. With heart disease being a leading cause of death globally, the goal was to explore how data and ML models can assist in early risk detection and support healthcare decisions.

📌 Use Case
The model can be used as a supportive tool by healthcare professionals to identify high-risk individuals based on routine health check-up data. It’s not a replacement for medical advice, but a step towards smarter, data-driven healthcare.

🧠 Problem Statement
Given a set of medical features like age, blood pressure, cholesterol level, chest pain type, ECG results, etc., predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Models Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix

🔍 Workflow
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset, handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and normalized numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understood patterns and correlations in the data.

Model Training: Trained multiple classification models and compared their performance.

Evaluation: Used various metrics to assess how well the models performed.

Feature Importance: Analyzed which medical features impacted the prediction most.

📈 Outcome
The best-performing model showed promising results in predicting heart disease based on the given features. More importantly, the project helped me understand how machine learning can be responsibly used in sensitive fields like healthcare.
